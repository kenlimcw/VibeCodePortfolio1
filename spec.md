SPEC.md: Portfolio Contact Form to n8n Integration1. Project OverviewGoal: Add a professional contact form to the existing Next.js portfolio.Workflow: User fills form $\rightarrow$ Next.js sends POST request $\rightarrow$ n8n Webhook $\rightarrow$ Google Sheets.Reasoning: Using n8n for the backend allows for easy scaling (e.g., adding WhatsApp/Email alerts later) without re-coding the website.2. Technical StackFrontend: Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (Icons).Backend Logic: Server Actions or API Route (Next.js).Automation: n8n (Webhook Trigger $\rightarrow$ Google Sheets Node).Environment: Windows 11 / PowerShell / Cursor IDE.3. Features & RequirementsA. The Contact Form (UI)Fields: Name, Email, Subject, Message.Validation: * Email must be valid format.All fields are required.Character limit for message (500 chars).UX: * Display a "Sending..." state during the request.Success message: "Message sent! I'll get back to you soon."Error message: "Something went wrong. Please try again."B. The Integration (Next.js to n8n)The form should send a JSON payload to an N8N_WEBHOOK_URL stored in .env.local.Payload Format:JSON{
  "name": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "subject": "string",
  "message": "string",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601"
}
C. The n8n Workflow (Reference Only)Webhook Node: HTTP Method POST, Path /contact-form.Google Sheets Node: Append a row to the "Leads" spreadsheet.Columns: Date, Name, Email, Subject, Message.4. Implementation Steps (Syllabus)[ ] Step 1: Create a new page/component src/app/contact/page.tsx.[ ] Step 2: Build the form UI using Tailwind for a professional look.[ ] Step 3: Setup .env.local with a placeholder N8N_WEBHOOK_URL.[ ] Step 4: Write the submission logic (using fetch or Next.js Server Actions).[ ] Step 5: Add "Success/Error" toast notifications.5. Constraints & GuardrailsPowerShell Only: All terminal commands must be compatible with PowerShell.Next.js Standards: Use lucide-react for icons and shadcn/ui patterns if applicable.Security: Ensure the Webhook URL is never hardcoded into the frontend; it must stay on the server-side.
